    "\n",
    "# In this example, the condition `age >= 18` is true, so the message \"You are an adult.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 2. `if-else` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "# if condition:\n",

    "# else:\n",
    "#     # code to execute if condition is false\n",

    "\n",
    "# ### 3. `if-elif-else` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "# The `if-elif-else` statement allows you to check multiple conditions. It evaluates each condition in order, and executes the corresponding block of code for the first true condition. If none of the conditions are true, the `else` block is executed.\n",

    "\n",
    "# ### 4. Nested `if` Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can also have `if` statements inside other `if` statements. This is useful for checking more complex conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "# It's a warm and dry day. Perfect for a walk!\n",
    "\n",
    "# In this example, the inner `if` checks if it's raining only if the temperature is above 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### 5. Using Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "# You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "# temperature = 22\n",
    "# humidity = 70\n",
    "\n",
    "# if temperature > 20 and humidity > 50:\n",
    "#     print(\"It's a warm and humid day.\")\n",
    "# else:\n",
    "#     print(\"The weather is not warm and humid.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "# It's a warm and humid day.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here, both conditions (temperature > 20 and humidity > 50) are true, so the message \"It's a warm and humid day.\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `if`: Executes a block of code if a condition is true.\n",
    "# - `if-else`: Provides an alternative block of code to execute if the condition is false.\n",
    "# - `if-elif-else`: Checks multiple conditions and executes the block of code corresponding to the first true condition.\n",

    "# Use Cases:\n",
    "# - When the number of iterations is not known beforehand.\n",
    "# - Looping until a certain condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1: Basic `while` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "# count = 0\n",
    "# while count < 5:\n",
    "#     print(count)\n",
    "#     count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# *Output*:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 2: Loop Until User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "# user_input = ''\n",
    "# while user_input != 'exit':\n",
    "#     user_input = input('Type \"exit\" to quit: ')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Other Loop Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "# - `break`: Exits the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.\n",
    "# - `continue`: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.\n",
    "# - `else` Clause: A loop can have an `else` clause which executes when the loop finishes naturally (i.e., not terminated by `break`).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example with `break` and `continue`\n",
    "\n",
    "# for num in range(10):\n",
    "#     if num == 5:\n",
    "#         break  # Exit the loop when num is 5\n",
    "#     elif num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "#         continue  # Skip the current iteration for even numbers\n",
    "#     print(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "# *Output*:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example with `else` Clause\n",
    "\n",
    "# for i in range(3):\n",
    "#     print(i)\n",
    "# else:\n",
    "#     print('Loop finished')\n",
    "\n",
    "# *Output*:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 0\n",
    "# 1\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "# Loop finished\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "# ### Summary\n",
    "# - `for` Loop: Used for iterating over a sequence with a known number of elements.\n",
    "# - `while` Loop: Used for repeating a block of code as long as a condition is true.\n",
    "# - Loop Control Statements: `break` to exit a loop, `continue` to skip an iteration, and `else` to execute a block of code when the loop terminates normally."
